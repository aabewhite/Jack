# Jack: fluent interface to Swift objects from JavaScript

Jack uses [JXKit](https://www.jective.org/JXKit/documentation/jxkit/)
to provide a simple way to export your Swift properties
and functions to an embedded JavaScript context.

The framework is cross-platform (iOS/macOS/tvOS/Linux) and 
can be used to export Swift instanced to a scripting
envrionment.
